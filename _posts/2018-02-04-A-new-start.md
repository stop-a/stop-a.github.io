I’ve decided to learn more about the “hacker” side of infosec. I hadn’t really gotten into capture the flag exercises or competitions. A friend and coworker started studying for the OSCP a while back and the stuff he was learning was really interesting and helped us do our “blue team” side better. When he said the boot-to-root challenges and CTF challenges were a good taste of what to expect, I thought I’d dig in and see what I could do. I’m taking a crack at the challenges on hackthebox.eu. These early write-up are going to be… …gross, probably. My note-taking on the early boxes was horrible. As a n00b, there was also quite a bit of thrashing around. I’m also out of practice when it comes to writing. Mustn’t let that stop me. So, here goes. Enjoy!
